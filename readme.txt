Animation Generator utility software for the DIY Gamer Kit

Keyboard Shortcuts
==================

Drawing
-------
c         > copy current image as Arduino Gamer library code
backspace > clear the current image
e     	  > toggle 'erase mode' (brush erases/turns pixels off rather than on)
i     	  > invert the current image

Animating
---------
=	  > add a blank frame
+	  > clone the current frame
-	  > remove the current frame
n	  > clear all frames (brand new animation)

Previewing
----------
space > toggle animation playback 
LEFT  > move playhead to the previous frame
NEXT  > move playhead to the next frame
ALT+C > copy the current frame
ALT+V > paste a copied frame (at the current location)
(hint: if a lot of blank frames are available you can draw while playing back which allows for a hacky sequencer like animation recorder)

GOTCHAS
=======
Currently the software only generates code, 
but it does not save the animation in a format that can be edited later
so for now it's safer to generate fast/short animations
